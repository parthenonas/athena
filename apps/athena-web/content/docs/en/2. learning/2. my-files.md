# Personal Storage

The **My Files** section is your personal cloud space within Athena LMS. You can upload homework assignments, project documents, and other materials required for your learning process here.

## Storage Usage

At the top of the page, you will see a widget displaying your current storage status.

The progress bar shows how much space you have used vs. your total limit (Quota). If you reach **100%**, you will not be able to upload new files until you delete old ones.

If you need more space, please contact your instructor or system administrator.
