# Role Management

The role model in Athena LMS allows for flexible configuration of user access to system functionality. Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user, an administrator creates a **Role** (e.g., "Instructor"), grants it a set of permissions, and assigns this role to users.

## Role List

The **Roles** section displays a list of all access configurations available in the system.

The table presents the following information:
* **Name:** Unique role name.
* **Access Level:** The number of granted permissions or a special **Super Admin** badge if the role has full rights.
* **Creation/Update Date.**

You can search the table by role name.

## Creating and Editing

To create a new role, click the **Create Role** button. The configuration panel will open.

::steps{level="4"}
#### Role Name
Enter a clear name (minimum 3 characters). It must be unique within the system.

#### Configuring Permissions
In the interface, permissions are grouped by functional modules (System, Courses, Users, etc.).
Check the boxes for actions that will be allowed for users with this role.

#### Saving
Click **Save**. Changes take effect immediately, although active users may need to re-login to update their access token.

### Super Admin

There is a special permission in the system — `admin` (Super Admin).
If this permission is granted to a role, the system will **ignore** any other restrictions for that role. The user will have full access to all functions and data.

Be extremely cautious when creating roles with the Super Admin flag.

## Deleting Roles

You can delete a role by clicking the trash icon.

**Data Integrity Constraint:**
The system will not allow you to delete a role if it is assigned to at least one user. This protects against "orphaned" accounts without access rights.

If an error occurs during deletion, first reassign the users to another role in the **Users** section.
