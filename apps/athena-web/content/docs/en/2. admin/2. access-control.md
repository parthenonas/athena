# Access Control System (ACL)

The security architecture of Athena LMS is built on a hybrid model combining **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) and elements of **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Permission
An atomic right to perform a specific action. Permissions are strings in the format `resource.action`.
* **Example:** `courses.create` — the right to create courses.

### 2. Role
A named container holding a list of permissions. A user always has exactly one role.

### 3. Policy
An additional condition restricting the scope of a permission. Policies allow implementing logic like "User has the right to edit a course, **BUT ONLY** if they are its author".

Policies are applied on top of permissions. If a permission is missing, the policy is irrelevant.

## Policy Reference

Currently, the system supports the following object policies:

| Policy | Description | Applies to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `OWN_ONLY` | Allows action only on objects where `ownerId` matches the user ID. | Courses, Files |
| `NOT_PUBLISHED` | Allows action only if the object is in draft status. | Courses |
| `ONLY_PUBLISHED` | Allows access only to published objects. | Courses, Lessons |
| `PUBLISHED_OR_OWNER` | Combined rule: sees published (as a student) AND own drafts (as an author). | Course Lists |

## Permission Matrix

Below is the full list of permissions available in the system, grouped by module.

### Accounts
Access management.
* `accounts.create` — Create users.
* `accounts.read` — View user list.
* `accounts.update` — Edit (change roles, reset passwords).
* `accounts.delete` — Archive/delete.

### Profiles
User personal data.
* `profiles.create` — Create profile.
* `profiles.read` — View profile details.
* `profiles.update` — Edit data.
* `profiles.delete` — Delete profile.

### Courses
Educational content.
* `courses.create` — Create a new course.
* `courses.read` — View courses.
* `courses.update` — Edit course settings.
* `courses.delete` — Delete course.
* `courses.publish` — Publish course (visible to students).

### Lessons
Content within a course.
* `lessons.create` — Add materials.
* `lessons.read` — View materials.
* `lessons.update` — Edit content.
* `lessons.delete` — Delete.

### Progress & Enrollments
* `enrollments.create` — Enroll students in a course.
* `enrollments.read` — View student lists.
* `progress.read` — View academic performance.
* `progress.update` — Grade assignments.

### System
* `admin` — Global access (Super-Admin). Bypasses policy checks.
* `blocks.execute` — Right to execute isolated code (Code Runner).
* `schedule.create` / `read` / `update` — Schedule management.
