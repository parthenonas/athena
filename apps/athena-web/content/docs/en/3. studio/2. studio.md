# Course Builder

The **Course Builder** is the primary environment for structuring educational content. It allows instructors to create lessons, arrange them in a logical sequence, and populate them with interactive blocks.

## Interface Overview

The workspace is organized into three functional areas:

::card-group
  ::card{title="1. Structure (Left)" icon="i-lucide-list-tree"}
  The navigation panel showing the hierarchy of lessons. Used for creating, selecting, and reordering course chapters.
  ::
  ::card{title="2. Canvas (Center)" icon="i-lucide-layout"}
  The editing area. Content blocks (text, code, video) are rendered here.
  ::
  ::card{title="3. Inspector (Right)" icon="i-lucide-settings-2"}
  Context-sensitive properties panel. Displays settings for the currently selected object (Lesson or Block).
  ::
::

## Managing Lessons

The course structure consists of **Lessons**. A lesson serves as a container for content blocks.

### Creating a Lesson

To add a new structural unit to the course:

::steps{level="4"}
#### Add
Click the **Add Lesson** button located at the bottom of the left sidebar.

#### Details
Fill in the form in the modal window:

::field-group
  :::field{name="Title" type="text" required="true"}
  The name of the lesson visible to students.
  :::
  :::field{name="Learning Goals" type="textarea"}
  Optional description of key takeaways or objectives for this lesson.
  :::
::

#### Draft Status
The **Save as Draft** option is enabled by default. This ensures the lesson remains hidden upon creation.

#### Save
Click **Save**. The lesson will immediately appear in the structure list.
::

### Draft System

Visibility is controlled via the **Status** section in the Inspector panel.

::alert{icon="i-lucide-eye-off" color="warning"}
**Drafts are invisible to students.**
Lessons marked as drafts are excluded from the student's learning path, even if the course itself is published.
::

The lesson state is indicated by icons in the sidebar:
* **Draft:** :icon{name="i-lucide-file-dashed" class="text-gray-400"} — Content is hidden.
* **Published:** :icon{name="i-lucide-file-check" class="text-primary-500"} — Content is visible.

### Reordering

The sequence of lessons can be modified at any time.

1.  Locate the lesson in the **Course Structure** sidebar.
2.  Click and hold the drag handle (:icon{name="i-lucide-grip-vertical"}) to the left of the lesson title.
3.  Drag the item to the desired position.

Changes are saved automatically and applied immediately.


## Canvas & Content Blocks

The **Canvas** is the central workspace where you assemble the lesson content. Athena LMS uses a streamlined block system to keep content organized.

### Adding Blocks

To add content to a lesson:

1.  Click the **Add Block** button located at the bottom of the canvas.
2.  Select the desired block type:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Text** | The primary block for theory. Supports rich text, images, videos, and tables. |
| **Code** | An interactive programming environment with syntax highlighting and auto-grading capabilities. |

### Managing Blocks

* **Selection:** Click on any block to select it. The active block is highlighted with a blue border.
* **Properties:** When a block is selected, the **Inspector** panel on the right updates to show its specific settings (e.g., Code Execution parameters).
* **Reordering:** Use the drag handle (:icon{name="i-lucide-grip-vertical"}) on the left of the block to move it up or down.
* **Deletion:** To remove a block, select it and click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the Inspector panel.

## Rich Text Editor

The **Text Block** is a powerful editor based on the Tiptap engine. It is designed to handle not just plain text, but all rich media content.

### Formatting
Select any text to reveal the **Bubble Menu** for quick actions:
* **Style:** Bold, Italic, Underline, Inline Code.
* **Links:** Insert hyperlinks.
* **Code:** Convert selection to a code snippet.

### Slash Commands & Media
You can insert media and format content without leaving the keyboard. Type `/` (forward slash) at the start of a new line to open the command menu.

**Available commands:**
* **Structure:** Headings (H1, H2, H3), Paragraph.
* **Lists:** Bullet List, Numbered List.
* **Media:**
    * **Image:** Inserts an upload widget. Supports drag-and-drop uploading.
    * **Video:** Inserts a video upload widget.
* **Insert:** Blockquote, Code Block (static), Horizontal Rule.

::note{icon="i-lucide-image"}
**Working with Media:**
Images and videos are embedded directly within the text flow. You can interact with them (view preview, delete) directly in the editor canvas.
::

## Code Blocks & Execution

The **Code Block** transforms a standard lesson into an interactive programming assignment. It features a built-in code editor, a compiler/interpreter, and an automated grading system.

### Anatomy of a Code Block

Each code block consists of three main components in the Canvas area:
1.  **Task Description:** A rich-text area above the editor where you define the problem statement.
2.  **Code Editor:** The interactive area where students write their solution.
3.  **Console:** Displays the execution result, errors, or grading status.

### Inspector Settings

To configure how the code is executed and graded, select the code block and look at the **Inspector** panel.

#### Environment
* **Language:** Select the programming language (e.g., Python, SQL).
* **Time Limit (ms):** The maximum time allowed for code execution. Default is 1000ms.
* **Memory Limit (MB):** The maximum RAM usage allowed. Default is 128MB.

::alert{icon="i-lucide-triangle-alert" color="warning"}
**Resource Limits:**
If a student's code exceeds these limits, the execution will be terminated with a `Time Limit Exceeded` (TLE) or `Memory Limit Exceeded` (MLE) error.
::

### Validation Logic

Athena LMS supports two distinct modes for verifying student submissions:

::card-group
  ::card{title="I/O Comparison" icon="i-lucide-arrow-left-right"}
  **Best for: Algorithms, Olympiad tasks.**
  The system feeds specific data to the program's **Standard Input (Stdin)** and compares the **Standard Output (Stdout)** against an expected string.
  ::
  ::card{title="Unit Tests" icon="i-lucide-flask-conical"}
  **Best for: Functions, Classes, Business Logic.**
  The system runs the student's code and then executes a hidden script (assertions) to verify the internal state or return values.
  ::
::

#### Mode 1: I/O Comparison
In the Inspector, fill in:
* **Input (STDIN):** Data sent to the program.
* **Expected Output (STDOUT):** The exact string the program must print to pass.

#### Mode 2: Unit Tests
When this mode is selected, the Code Editor in the Canvas expands to show additional tabs:

1.  **Solution:** The starter code for the student.
2.  **Tests (Hidden):** Write assertions here (e.g., `assert add(2, 2) == 4`). This code runs *after* the student's code.
3.  **Setup Scripts (Hidden):** Code that runs *before* the student's code (e.g., initializing a database or importing libraries).

::note{icon="i-lucide-eye-off"}
**Visibility:**
The "Tests" and "Setup Scripts" tabs are visible only to the instructor in the Builder. Students only see the "Solution" tab.
::

## Inspector & Settings

The **Inspector** panel on the right is context-aware. It dynamically changes its content based on your selection in the Canvas or Sidebar.

### Context Switching
* **Lesson Settings:** Click on the lesson title in the sidebar to view general properties (Title, Goals, Draft Status).
* **Block Settings:** Click on a specific block in the canvas to configure its specific parameters (e.g., Code Limits, Video URL).

### Required Action (Progress Tracking)

For every content block, you must define how a student completes it. This setting controls the progress bar and unlocking logic.

Located in the **General Settings** section of the Inspector:

| Action Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **View** | The student simply needs to scroll past or view the content. Default for Text/Image blocks. |
| **Submit** | The student must perform an action that returns a success result. Mandatory for **Code Blocks** (tests must pass). |
| **Interact** | Requires active engagement (e.g., clicking a button or playing a video). |
| **Pass** | No specific action required; purely informational. |

::note{icon="i-lucide-check-circle"}
**Best Practice:**
Always set **Code Blocks** to `Submit`. If set to `View`, a student could skip the coding task without writing a single line of code.
::

## Preview Mode

Before publishing changes, it is essential to verify how the content appears to the end user.

### Toggling Preview
Click the **Preview** button (:icon{name="i-lucide-eye"}) in the top navigation bar.

### What happens in Preview Mode?
1.  **Read-Only Interface:** All editing tools, toolbars, and drag handles are hidden.
2.  **Student Experience:** You can interact with code blocks, run tests, and view media exactly as a student would.
3.  **Clean Layout:** The Inspector panel is hidden to maximize the reading area.

To return to editing, click the **Edit** button (:icon{name="i-lucide-pencil"}) in the header.
