# Course Manager

The **Course Manager** is the central hub for content creators. Here you can create new courses, manage their lifecycle (Draft vs. Published), and access the Course Builder to structure your lessons.

## Overview

The main view provides a list of all courses you have created or have access to edit.

::card-group
  ::card{title="Drafts" icon="i-lucide-pencil"}
  Courses that are currently being worked on. They are **not visible** to students in the "Learning" section.
  ::
  ::card{title="Published" icon="i-lucide-globe"}
  Courses that are live and accessible to enrolled students.
  ::
::

You can switch between these lists using the tabs at the top of the page.

## Creating a Course

To start a new learning path, click the **Create Course** button.

::steps{level="4"}
#### Basic Info
Enter the **Title** of the course. This is the only mandatory field to get started.

#### Description & Tags
Optionally, add a description to help students understand what they will learn. You can also add **Tags** (e.g., `Math`, `Physics`, `Beginner`) to make the course easier to find.

#### Save
Click **Save**. The course will be created as a **Draft** automatically. You will see it in the list immediately.

## Managing Courses

Each row in the table offers quick actions:

* **:icon{name="i-lucide-blocks"} Builder:** Opens the detailed course structure editor where you manage lessons and content blocks.
* **:icon{name="i-lucide-pencil"} Edit:** Re-opens the slideover to change the title, description, or tags.
* **:icon{name="i-lucide-trash"} Delete:** Permanently removes the course.

::warning{icon="i-lucide-triangle-alert"}
**Deleting a course is irreversible.** It will also delete all associated lessons, content blocks, and student progress data linked to this course.
::

## Course Builder

Clicking on the course title or the **Builder** icon takes you to the deep editing mode. Here you can:
1.  Create **Lessons** (Chapters).
2.  Add **Content Blocks** (Text, Video, Code, Quizzes) to lessons.
3.  Configure **Flow** (sequential unlocking logic).
