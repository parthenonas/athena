# User Management

The **Users** section is designed for administering accounts of all system participants: students, instructors, and other administrators. Here you can create new accounts, assign roles, reset passwords, and manage access status.

## Viewing the List

Upon entering the section, a table displaying all system users is shown.

::card-group
  ::card{title="Search" icon="i-lucide-search"}
  The search bar allows filtering users by **Login**. The search supports partial matching.
  ::
  ::card{title="Filtering" icon="i-lucide-filter"}
  The list can be sorted by registration date, login, or status.
  ::

## Creating an Account

To add a new user, click the **Create Account** button in the top right corner. A creation slideover will open.

::steps{level="4"}
#### Fill in Details
Complete the required form fields:

::field-group
  :::field{name="Login" type="text" required="true"}
  Unique user identifier in the system. Minimum length is 3 characters.
  :::
  :::field{name="Password" type="password" required="true"}
  Initial password for login.
  :::
  :::field{name="Role" type="select" required="true"}
  User access level (e.g., *Student* or *Teacher*).
  :::
::

#### Password Security Requirements
To ensure system security, the password must meet the following criteria:
* Minimum **8 characters**.
* Contain **mixed case** letters (A-z).
* Contain at least one **digit** (0-9).
* Contain at least one **special character** (!@#$%).

#### Save
Click the **Save** button. The system will automatically check login uniqueness. If the login is taken, an error message will be displayed.
::

## Editing and Password Reset

To change user data, click the edit button (pencil icon) in the table row.

### Changing Role
You can change a user's role at any time. Access rights are updated immediately, although the user may need to relogin for new policies to take effect.

### Password Reset
If a user forgets their password, an administrator can manually set a new one.

::note{icon="i-lucide-key"}
In the edit window, the **Password** field is empty by default.
* Leave it empty to **keep the current password**.
* Enter a new password to **reset** the old one.

## User Statuses

Status determines the ability to log in to the system.

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| :badge{label="Active" color="primary" variant="subtle"} | The user has full access to the system according to their role. |
| :badge{label="Temporary Blocked" color="warning" variant="subtle"} | Access is temporarily restricted (e.g., after consecutive failed login attempts). Usually lifted automatically or manually. |
| :badge{label="Blocked" color="error" variant="subtle"} | Complete access ban. Used for expelled students or dismissed employees. |

## Deleting Users

The system supports "Soft Delete".

1.  Click the delete button (trash bin icon) in the user row.
2.  Confirm the action in the modal window.

::warning{icon="i-lucide-triangle-alert"}
A deleted account is marked as `deleted` in the database and hidden from the list, but the data is physically preserved for history and integrity of relationships.
