# Media & Storage

The **Files** section in the admin panel serves two main purposes: managing the global repository of files (assets) and configuring storage limits (quotas) for different user roles.

## File Manager

The main table displays files uploaded to the system. As an administrator, you have access to manage content that might need moderation or public assets used in the system.

::card-group
  ::card{title="Access Levels" icon="i-lucide-lock"}
  * **Public**: Files accessible to anyone via a direct link (e.g., course covers, avatars).
  * **Private**: Secure files accessible only to the owner and authorized roles (e.g., homework, certificates).
  ::
  ::card{title="Actions" icon="i-lucide-mouse-pointer-click"}
  You can **Download** any file to inspect content or **Delete** it to free up space. Deleted files are removed permanently from S3 storage.

### Uploading Assets
Admins can upload files directly (e.g., system logos or default placeholders). By default, admin uploads are set to **Public** access.

## Quota Management

Athena LMS uses a role-based quota system to manage storage costs and prevent abuse.



To manage limits, click the **:icon{name="i-lucide-database"} Manage Quotas** button in the top right corner. A configuration panel will slide out.

### Default Policy
By default, **every role** in the system has a storage limit of **100 MB**. This ensures that new roles created in the future are automatically restricted without manual intervention.

### Configuring Exceptions
You can override the default limit for specific roles (e.g., giving Teachers more space than Students).

::steps{level="4"}
#### Open Manager
Click **Manage Quotas**. You will see a list of currently active exceptions (rules).

#### Add Rule
1. Click **Add Rule**.
2. Select a **Role** from the dropdown list.
3. Enter the new limit in **Megabytes (MB)**.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Edit or Reset
* **Edit:** Change the number in the input field next to the role and click the save icon.
* **Reset:** Click the trash icon to remove the rule. The role will immediately revert to the default **100 MB** limit.
