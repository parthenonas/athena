# Getting Started

Athena LMS is a web-based learning management system designed to organize the educational process, manage courses, and monitor academic performance. This guide provides instructions on the initial system login and an overview of the main user interface elements.

Athena LMS is an open-source project. We welcome community participation in the platform's development. The source code is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/shekshuev/athena-lms). If you discover an error or wish to propose an improvement, please create an Issue in the project repository.

## System Requirements

The system is implemented as a web application and does not require installing additional software on the user's workstation. A modern web browser with JavaScript support enabled is required for correct operation.

Supported browsers (latest versions):
* **Google Chrome**
* **Mozilla Firefox**
* **Microsoft Edge**
* **Safari**

Using outdated browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) is not supported and may lead to incorrect interface rendering or errors in functional modules.
